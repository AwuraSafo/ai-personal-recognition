# AI Personal Recognition

This repository explores moments when artificial intelligence seems to recognize 
individual users. These reflections focus on memory, context, trust, and ethical 
implications in human-AI interaction.

The posts consider how AI can feel personal, how users respond to it, and what 
designers need to consider to balance helpfulness with responsibility.
